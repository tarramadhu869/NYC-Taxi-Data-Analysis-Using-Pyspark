# NYC-Taxi-Data-Analysis-Using-Pyspark
**Problem Statement**
The problem statement of the **NYC Taxi Data Analysis** and Optimization project is to analyze the vast amount of taxi trip data from New York City (NYC) and identify opportunities to optimize various aspects of the taxi system. This includes improving operational efficiency, enhancing service quality, and maximizing revenue for taxi drivers and companies.
**What are the pickup and drop hotspots?
Peak Hours to book a trip
Average Passengers per trip
Most Trip type within or intercity
Toll Price
Most busy days of a week
Average Tip amount
How distance change the price of the ride?**
These are some the questions we need answer in order to increase revenue, manage the taxi availability and overall estimate the profit from each trip. So let's get started.
